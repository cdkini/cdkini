## Hi, I'm Chetan 👋

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2018 with a degree in accounting. I spent two years working as a consultant at Deloitte and after learning Python to automate processes and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I'm currently in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and have spent most of it writing tools for the Recurse community in Go, Python, and TypeScript.

- 🌱 Currently learning: React & TypeScript
- 💻 Let's talk about: vim, tmux, fzf, rg, and all the other fun tools living in the terminal
- 👯 I’m looking to work as a **Backend Developer**
