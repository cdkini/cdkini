## Hi, I'm Chetan 👋

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2018 with a degree in accounting. I spent two years working as a consultant at Deloitte and after learning Python to automate processes and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I just wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in early 2021 and now work at [Superconductive](https://www.superconductive.com), where I'm working on [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/)!

- 🌱 Currently learning: Some functional programming!
- 💻 Let's talk about: vim, tmux, fzf, rg, and all the other wonderful tools living in the terminal
