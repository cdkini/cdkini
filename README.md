## Hi, I'm Chetan ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2018 with a degree in accounting. I spent two years working as a consultant at Deloitte and after learning Python to automate processes and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in early 2021 and now work fulltime on [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Acdkini+)!
