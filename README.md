## Hi, I'm Chetan ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2018 with a degree in accounting. I spent two years working as a consultant at Deloitte and after learning Python to automate processes and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in early 2021 and now work at [Superconductive](https://www.superconductive.com), where I'm working on [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/)!

- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: [qn](https://github.com/cdkini/qn) - A CLI-based notetaking application
